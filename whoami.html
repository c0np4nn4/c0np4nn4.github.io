<p>
  I am a master's student in the PACL @ DGIST
</p>

<p>
  Currently, My work focuses on ...
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Coding theory, especially erasure-correcting codes</li>
  <li>Proof systems such as IOPP and PCPP</li>
  <li>Commitment schemes, including polynomial and functional commitments</li>
</ul>

<p>
  I like the Rust programming language ðŸ¦€.<br/>
  Iâ€™ve done a bit of open-source work on Reth and a couple of other projects
</p>

<p>
  I use Vim all the time.<br/>
  It feels a bit outdated, but I enjoy the efficiency of its keybindings.
